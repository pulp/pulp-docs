## Quick Links

!!! note "About versions"

    The `version` column is the latest on main and it's what we publish.

    You might encounter some unreleased content live, but plugins usually release often.
    Also, we try to include version information on the docs itself.

{%- for title, kind in [("Core", "Core"), ("Content Plugins", "Content"), ("Deployment", "Deployment"), ("Interaction", "Interaction"), ("Others", "Other")] %}

### {{ title }}

Component | Version | Links | &nbsp; | &nbsp;
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
{%- for component in components if component.kind == kind %}
{{ component.title }} | `{{ component.version }}` | {{ component.links | join(" | ") }}
{%- endfor %}
{%- endfor %}
