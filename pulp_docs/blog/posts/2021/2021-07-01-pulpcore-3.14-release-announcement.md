# 3.14 - headline features

We are happy to announce the release of Pulpcore 3.14!

This release contains a number of bug fixes and enhancements. In this blog, we'll take a look at
the headline features.

A gentle reminder that the [Community Survey](https://forms.gle/KJDoSdqWf5ajut5f6) is open,
and we would love to hear from you.

## Pulp has a new queueless tasking system! [#8501](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8501)  

The largest and most significant change introduced with this release is the new tasking system.
 With this change, Pulp no longer needs a resource manager.

If you'd like an in-depth look at the motivations, benefits, and details of the new tasking system,
read [Matthias Dellweg's blog post](https://pulpproject.org/2021/06/21/a-new-tale/) and also watch
 a YouTube livestreamed interview with Matthias conducted by Pulp's Brian Bouterse:

As part of the work to implement this feature, this release also introduces a new more "graceful" shutdown for Pulpcore
workers [#8930](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8930)

Note that for the moment, this feature is in tech-preview.
Please [let us know what you think](https://pulpproject.org/help/#github-discussions).

### Sticking with the old tasking system?
If you intend to keep using the old tasking system, you should configure the `USE_NEW_WORKER_TYPE`
setting to `False` before upgrading. For more information about how to enable or disable the new
tasking system, see the [documentation](https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulpcore/configuration/settings.html#use-new-worker-type).


## New Orphan Cleanup Endpoint [#8658](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8658)

This release introduces the `/pulp/api/v3/orphans/cleanup/` endpoint.
When you call this endpoint with `POST` and no parameters, it is the equivalent of calling.
`DELETE /pulp/api/v3/orphans/`. Note that as part of this release,
`DELETE /pulp/api/v3/orphans/` has been deprecated.

You can specify a list of `content_hrefs` to delete using the optional parameter `content_hrefs`
with list of content hrefs. In this case, only the specified content units will be deleted by the
orphan cleanup.

## Increased Retries on Failed Downloads [#8881](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8881)

The default behavior for retrying downloads from remote sources after an error occurs has been
updated. Downloads will now be retried on a wider range of errors, for example, HTTP 500 and
websocket errors. The default number of retries is 3.

If you're a plugin writer, you also have the option to configure the number of retries for your
plugin with the new `DEFAULT_MAX_RETRIES` field that has been added to the ``Remote`` base class.

## Filter the task list with correlation ID [#8891](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8891)

When using the task list endpoint, you can now filter the list by correlation ID to see all tasks being emitted by a single user action.

## Changes to Download Concurrency [#8897](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8897)

Previously, `download_concurrency` would be set to a default value upon creation. With this release,
the default value is set to `NULL` and returns `NULL` when queried. However, a default value will
still be used. This value comes from the Pulp global settings or can be set by the plugin writer.

## Updates to the Plugin API

Here is a summary of changes to the Plugin API in this release:

*  ``pulpcore.plugin.viewsets.DistributionFilter`` has been added. Use this instead of  
``pulpcore.plugin.viewsets.NewDistributionFilter``.
  [#8480](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8480)

* ``user_hidden`` field has been added to ``Repository``, with which you can hide repositories from users.
  [#8487](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8487)

* ``timestamp_of_interest`` field has been added to Content and Artifacts.
This field can be updated by calling a new method ``touch()`` on Artifacts and Content.
Plugin writers should call this method whenever they deal with Content or Artifacts.
For example, this includes places where Content is uploaded or added to Repository Versions.
This will prevent Content and Artifacts from being cleaned up when orphan cleanup becomes a
non-blocking task in pulpcore 3.15.
  [#8823](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8823)

* ``AsyncUpdateMixin`` has been exposed through ``pulpcore.plugin.viewsets``.
  [#8844](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8844)

* ``DEFAULT_MAX_RETRIES`` field to the ``Remote`` base class - plugin writers can override
the default number of retries attempted when file downloads failed for each type of remote.
The default value is 3.
  [#8881](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8881)

* ``DEFAULT_DOWNLOAD_CONCURRENCY`` field has been added to the Remote base class - plugin writers can
override the number of concurrent downloads for each type of remote. The default value is 10.
  [#8897](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8897)

### Plugin API Removals


Using non-JSON serializable types of ``args`` and ``kwargs`` to tasks is no longer supported.
`uuid.UUID` objects however will silently be converted to ``str``.
  [#8501](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8501)

The `versions_containing_content` method has been removed from the `pulpcore.plugin.models.RepositoryVersion`
object. Instead use `RepositoryVersion.objects.with_content()`.
  [#8729](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8729)

The `pulpcore.plugin.stages.ContentUnassociation` has been removed from the plugin API.
  [#8827](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8827)


### Plugin API deprecations

The ``pulpcore.plugin.viewsets.NewDistributionFilter`` is deprecated and will be removed from a
  future release. Instead use ``pulpcore.plugin.viewsets.DistributionFilter``.
  [#8480](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8480)

Deprecate the use of the `reserved_resources_record__resource` in favor of
`reserved_resources_record__contains`. Tentative removal release is pulpcore==3.15.
  [#8501](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8501)

Plugin writers who create custom downloaders by subclassing ``HttpDownloader`` no longer need to
wrap the ``_run()`` method with a ``backoff`` decorator. Consequntly the ``http_giveup`` handler for the
 sake of the ``backoff`` decorator is no longer needed and has been deprecated.
 It is likely to be removed in pulpcore 3.15.
  [#8881](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8881)
