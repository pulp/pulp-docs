This is a summary of the Pulp community goings-on  over the last few weeks!

## Pulp Community Survey

This year, we decided to pare the survey down to seven simple open questions. We've been delighted with the responses so far. We don't collect usage data on the project, so the more information you share with us, the more we can factor your scenarios and considerations into our plans. Given the size of the Pulp project, your feedback can have a very real impact on the future of Pulp, so please take the time to [complete the short survey](https://forms.gle/C3QwT9SVncXETipu9).

## Pulpcore 3.14 has been released!

The major feature of this release was the move to the new tasking system. In the lead-up to this release, Matthias Dellweg and Brian Bouterse hosted an information session in the form of a YouTube livestream, you can rewatch the event here:

## Pulp 3 session for Katello users

At the Foreman Birthday Party on July 1, Matthias Dellweg gave a presentation entitled **Pulp 3 introduction for Katello users - exploring the backend and tracing issues**. This session was the most popular event at the Foreman birthday party probably because the Foreman community are either in the midst of migrating from Pulp 2 to 3, or are now using Pulp 3. If you use Pulp through Katello, this session might be of interest to you.

## GitHub Discussions

Over the last few weeks, we have been trialing moving away from mailing lists and towards a more modern and accessible forum for discussing issues related to the Pulp community. For the last while, we have tried [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/pulp/community/discussions/).

Here are some conversations of note going on over the last few weeks:

* [Dropping support for Python 3.6 and Django 2](https://github.com/pulp/community/discussions/3)
* [Making pulp logging more configurable](https://github.com/pulp/community/discussions/20)
* [Optimizing the database fields key generation](https://github.com/pulp/community/discussions/47)


We've asked for opinions on using GitHub Discussions and heard that Pulp users might struggle to keep up to date because GitHub notifications are quite noisy and filtering notification emails can be hard. We're looking into other trial options, like Discourse. We will update our website and blog this happens! We would love to hear what you think. If you have any opinions, feedback or suggestions, let us know!
