## Pulp Community YouTube Live Event

Last week, Matthias Dellweg posted a blog about the [new tasking system](https://pulpproject.org/2021/06/21/a-new-tale/) that will be introduced with the release of Pulpcore 3.14

Tomorrow, June 29, we will host an information session about the new tasking system. This event will stream live on YouTube and we welcome any questions or feedback that you might have.

Here is a link to the YouTube livestream. If can only watch back at a later stage and have questions, feel free to [contact us](/chat-to-us/).

Looking forward to hearing what you think about the new tasking system!
