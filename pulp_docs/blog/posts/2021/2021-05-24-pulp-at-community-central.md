Last week, Brian Bouterse gave a talk entitled **Using Pulp 3 - Simpler and Faster**, which included a comprehensive overview of Pulp 3, as well as a demo of some of the main Pulp workflows for different content types using our brand new Pulp 3 CLI. The [Pulp 3 CLI](https://github.com/pulp/pulp-cli) is evolving fast, and we're hoping that it improves your experience with Pulp. We have an open call for feedback on the [Pulp 3 CLI](https://github.com/pulp/pulp-cli), so if you'd like to tell us about it, complete [this survey](https://forms.gle/NbPgrjErxCPaEkQJ8)!
