## 7 Questions for you!

We know your time is precious, so this year we thinned out our survey to comprise of only seven questions. The seventh question is just an open box, where we hope you can tell us anything that you might think is useful to help us improve Pulp.

[Take the survey now](https://forms.gle/r7qrbgE8RsxjdmCT8)!

## Pulp is Leaving Freenode

This probably isn't the first time you're hearing that many FOSS communities have left Freenode IRC and moved elsewhere. Pulp is no different. We now consider Matrix our Primary channel for communication. If you'd like to hang out and chat with the Pulp community, you can do so on the following Matrix channels:

If you want to use IRC, you can find corresponding rooms on Libera.Chat that are bridged to our new Matrix rooms.

You can find an up-to-date list of our channels and their purpose on our [Chat to us](/help/#chat-to-us) page.

## GitHub Discussions

After a recent Pulp Open Floor meeting, we decided to test the possibility of retiring our mailing lists. User feedback has suggested that the barrier of entry is high (you need to join the list to ask one question) and the mode of communication is outdated. We want to remove as many barriers of entry for users and contributors as possible. For these reasons, we are centralizing all of our discussions and meeting notes on a [Community Github Discussions](https://github.com/pulp/community/discussions). We would love to know what you think about it! If it works out, we might decommission our mailing lists.

## Move to GitHub Issues?

In a further effort to incorporate feedback from the Pulp community about our contribution process, we plan to migrate from our Pulp Redmine to GitHub Issues. We hope that with this move, we will reduce some of the overhead of contributing to Pulp. If you'd like to join in the discussion and share your experience, see [Github Issues migration meeting](https://github.com/pulp/community/discussions/9).

## Installing Pulp on Openshift

Fabricio has shared an end-to-end demo of how you can set up and deploy Pulp on Openshift. You can also find corresponding documentation for this process [here](https://pulp-operator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). If you're interested to see this in action, you can watch here:
