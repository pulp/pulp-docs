<!-- more -->
We are happy to announce the release of Pulpcore 3.10!

Letâ€™s take a look at some of the main features of this release. For a list of bug fixes, see the [changelog](https://docs.pulpproject.org/en/3.10/changes.html)

## Pre-validation import parameters

A synchronous **import-check** command has been added to validate a number of possible causes of import/export failure. This command does not do tests that require database access or long-running tasks such as verifying checksums. All parameters are optional. [#7549](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7549)

For more information, check out the [Pulp Import and Export workflow](https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulpcore/en/3.10/workflows/import-export.html) documentation.

## Update to the default Pulp deployment layout

`MEDIA_ROOT` is now its own directory. This change has the advantage of limiting the file permissions and the SELinux file contexts in a shared Pulp 2 and Pulp 3 deployment. This also adds compatibility with the `django_extensions' unreferenced_files` command, which lists all files in `MEDIA_ROOT` that are not in the database.

Other paths are kept on the same absolute paths.

The settings and logging documentation has been updated to reflect these changes. [#7178](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7178)

## New generic list endpoint

This release includes new endpoints that you can use to list all `Content`, `ContentGuards`, and `Repositories`. [#7204](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7204)

## Update to the SigningService

A new `public_key` field has been added to the **SigningService**. This field preserves the value of the public key. A new `pubkey_fingerprint` field was introduced as well, which identifies the
public key. [#7700](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7700)

As a result of this, the following deprecation notice has been added for this release:

`The public key needs to be specified during the new instance creation.
Other ways of providing the public key are considered deprecated as of the release.`


## New name filtering options

In previous versions, you could only query the API to search for exact names. With this release, new querying parameters have been added, such as `name__icontains`, `name__contains`, and `name__startswith`, to make searching for objects easier. [#8094](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8094)


## New filter capability for user and group endpoints

You can now filter lists of users and groups.  [#7975](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7975)

The users endpoint now has the following filter options:         

```
fields = {
     "username": ["exact", "iexact", "in", "contains", "icontains"],
     "first_name": ["exact", "iexact", "in", "contains", "icontains"],
     "last_name": ["exact", "iexact", "in", "contains", "icontains"],
     "email": ["exact", "iexact", "in", "contains", "icontains"],
     "is_active": ["exact"],
     "is_staff": ["exact"],
 }

```

The group endpoint now has the following filter options:

```
fields = {
         "id": ["exact", "in"],
         "name": ["exact", "iexact", "in", "contains", "icontains"],
     }
```


## Add your own labels to objects

With the addition of the `pulp_labels` field, you can create labels to add your own key/data for your resources in Pulp. You can also modify and remove these labels if needed.  

The `pulp_label_select` filter was added so that you can now filter by the labels you assign.

The `Label` and `LabelSerializer` have also been added to the Plugin API. [#8065](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8065)


For more information, see the [Labels](https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulpcore/workflows/labels.html) documentation.

## New optional Header field added for aiohttp ClientSession

You now have the option to specify headers in aiohttp ClientSession. Headers must be
provided as a dictionary or a JSON field. You can set headers for an entire
client session or per request. [#8083](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8083)

## RBAC

There have been a number of features added that relate to the ongoing effort to add role based access control (RBAC) functionality to Pulp.

* Users with view group permissions can view groups. [#8159](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8159)
* Users with change group permissions can modify groups. [8160](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8160)
* Authenticated users can create and view artifacts. [#8193](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8193)
* Filtering has been added for access policies.  [#8189](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8189)


### New AccessPolicy.customized field.

The `AccessPolicy.customized` field is a read-only field that defaults to `False`.
If `True`, this indicates that the user has modified the default access policy. [#8182](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8182)

This will be useful for:

* Users to see how a system's RBAC has been modified
* Plugin writers who want to ship changes or bugfixes to default policies they previously shipped and don't want to overwrite a user's custom policy.

## Mandatory version attributes for plugins

Plugins are required to define a `version` attribute on their subclass of `PulpPluginAppConfig`. Starting with `pulpcore==3.10`, if the `version` attribute is undefined while Pulp loads, Pulp will refuse to start. [#7930](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7930)

## New Plugin API features

* You can use the `rate_limit` option to specify the rate limit, in seconds, for a remote. [#7965](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7965)
* `DistributionFilter` is now accessible to plugin writers. [#8059](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8059)
* `Label` and `LabelSerializer` are now available in the Plugin API. [#8065](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8065)
* `LabelSelectFilter` has been added to filter resources by labels.
 [#8067](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8067)
* The `NAME_FILTER_OPTIONS` has been added to the Plugin API to gain more consistency across plugins when filtering by name or similar CharFields.
[#8117](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8117)
* A `ReadOnlyRepositoryViewset` has been added to the plugin API. This allows only a `GET` method to be used on a repository type that is not managed by the user.
 [#8103](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8103)
* The `has_repo_attr_obj_perms` and `has_repo_attr_model_or_obj_perms` checks have been added to the list of global access checks that are available for all plugins to use. [#8161](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8161)

## Removals

The default permission class changed from `IsAuthenticated` to `IsAdminUser`. Any endpoints that should be accessible by all known to the system users need to specify the `permission_classes` accordingly [#8018](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8018)

As part of [#7908](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7908) in the Pulpcore 3.9 release, `UnsupportedDigestValidationError` was added to `pulpcore.plugin.exceptions` but still accessible via `pulpcore.plugin.models`. With this release `UnsupportedDigestValidationError` has been removed from `pulpcore.plugin.models` and exists only in `pulpcore.plugin.exceptions`.

## Deprecations

As part of the changes mentioned [above](/update-to-the-signingservice/) around the **SigningService**, access to the path of the public key of a signing service was deprecated. The value of the public key is now expected to be saved in the model instance as `SigningService.public_key`. [7700](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7700)

The `pulpcore.plugin.storage.get_plugin_storage_path()` method has been present for some time but is not used anywhere. It is now deprecated. [#7935](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7935)
