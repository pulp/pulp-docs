The Pulp team are pleased to announce the release of Pulp 3.8.0!

## Updates to Django settings

* The Django `admin` site URL is now configurable using the new `ADMIN_SITE_URL` settings parameter [7637](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7637).

* As a follow up to [#7179](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7179), which provided a default `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` variable, in this release, the default `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` variable is now set everywhere. This simplifies configuration because the **systemd** service no longer has to set this value [#7720](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7720).

## Allowed Content Checksums Validation

In the previous release `ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS` variable was introduced so that users can specify and limit unwanted checksums in their environment.

In this release, validation has been added so that if a user has Artifacts in their database and adds checksums to `ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS` that do not match the existing Artifacts, the error `ImproperlyConfigured` is thrown [#7487](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7487).

## Dynaconf Version Requirement

Earlier versions of dynaconf had some known issues. In this release, the required dynaconf version is 3.1.2. [#7682](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7682).

## Installer Updates

In this release, there are a number of enhancements to pulp_installer:

* pulp_installer now compiles and installs the **pulpcore-selinux** policy on CentOS/RHEL/Fedora [#7574](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7574).
* When installing from distro packages (`pulp_install_source==packages`), from a repo (`pulp_pkg_repo`), and upgrading them (`pulp_pkg_upgrade_all==true`), pulp_installer now upgrades all the packages from the repo. This addresses any incorrect dependency declarations in the repo, which might cause pulp_installer to fail on `collectstatic`.[#7646](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7646).
* Users can customize webserver ports that Pulp listen on via `pulp_webserver_http_port` (defaults to 80) and `pulp_webserver_https_port` (defaults to 443) [#7662](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7662).
* pulp_installer now uses the new libexec wrappers from the RPM packages for rq and gunicorn to run them in the correct SELinux context [#7667](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7667).

### Installer Deprecations and Removals

This release contains the following changes to the pulp_installer:

* pulp_installer no longer sets SELinux to enabled, permissive and enforcing (casually referred to as "disabled") on CentOS/RHEL/Fedora.
  [#7573](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7573)
* pulp_installer no longer supports installing from older RPM packages that lack the wrapper scripts `/usr/libexec/pulpcore/{rq,gunicorn}`.
  [#7667](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7667)


## Plugin_template Update

Plugin template now contains a `check-manifest` script that is run in Travis and checks if all expected files are included in the MANIFEST.in [#7656]( https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7656).

## Bug Fixes

* When a task was cancelled, it was logging as a failed task [#4559](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/4559)
* When a task was cancelled, the status of all incomplete "progress reports" was remaining in an in-progress state [#4921](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/4921)
* A fix has been added to handle duplicate content during synchronization and migration from Pulp 2 to Pulp 3 [#7147](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7147)
* Content streaming has been enabled for Distributions that use Repository Versions instead of Publications [#7568](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7568)
* The `urlize_quoted_links` filter in Django Rest Framework was dropped because Django's `urlize` filter does the same action [#7634](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7634)


## Doc Improvements

* Updated examples of auto-distribution  [#5247](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/5247).
* Improved testing section in Pulp contributor doc [#7475](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7475).
* Fix an erroneous API endpoint in the "upload and publish" workflow documentation [#7655](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7655).
* Documented that Pulp doesn't support backporting migrations [#7657](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7657).
