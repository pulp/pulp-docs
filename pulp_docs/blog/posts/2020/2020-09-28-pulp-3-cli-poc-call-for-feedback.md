<!-- more -->
On the `pulp-dev` mailing list, we have [discussed](https://www.mail-archive.com/pulp-dev@redhat.com/msg04004.html) how the lack of a CLI might be a limitation or potential blocker to using Pulp 3. In our recent community survey, many community members expressed the need for a Pulp 3 CLI. At PulpCon 2020, there was a session dedicated to a Pulp 3 CLI discussion. In that session, there was a demo the initial PoC for the Pulp 3 CLI. At this point, we need your help to progress with the development of a Pulp 3 CLI.

We want to build a Pulp 3 CLI to suit the needs and requirements of the wider Pulp community. To do this, we need your feedback, thoughts, and suggestions on what we have put together so far. We want to avoid developing features without knowing if it will help you and your use cases.

If you're willing to install and test the current Pulp 3 CLI PoC and let us know your feedback, for example, whether this would suit your deployment or whether there are specific gaps or pitfalls etc, this would greatly help shape the future direction of the Pulp 3 CLI development. For anyone who participates and provides feedback on the Pulp 3 CLI PoC, we would be very happy to ship some Pulp SWAG as a thank you!
