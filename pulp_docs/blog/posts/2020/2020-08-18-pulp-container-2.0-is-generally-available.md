The Pulp team is pleased to announce the release of Pulp Container 2.0.0.

This release features push API support for Docker and Podman clients. This enhancement greatly simplifies the workflow for managing containers in Pulp.

You can now push a container image to the repositories hosted by the Container Registry. For an example workflow see [Push content to a repository](https://pulp-container.readthedocs.io/en/latest/workflows/push.html#push-content-to-a-repository) in the Pulp Container plugin documentation. This release also includes security features and restrictions to ensure that you can manage container content in a secure manner.

For information about all Pulp Container workflows, see [workflows](https://pulp-container.readthedocs.io/en/latest/workflows/index.html).

You can find Pulp Container 2.0.0 on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pulp-container/2.0.0/).
