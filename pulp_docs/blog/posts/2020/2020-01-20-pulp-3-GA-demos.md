To go along with Pulp 3.0 GA, we have prepared a playlist of demos to cover features in pulpcore on
the [Pulp YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/pulpproject).

Check it out and let us know if you find it useful.  Also, if there is any content you don't see but
would like a demo to cover, [please reach out](https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/pulp-list) to
us with that request.
