A bug fix release has been built to the v1 stable repository (<a href="http://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/pulp/pulp/v1/stable/" target="new">http://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/pulp/pulp/v1/stable/</a>). The fixed bug list can be found below.

## Upgrade

One of the bug fixes present in this release is to address a situation that may arise when two similarly named packages have similar checksums (a small chance however we actually managed to run into it). As part of that fix, existing packages need to be migrated to a new directory structure. This release contains a script to perform that migration. Instructions on running that script can be found [on the Pulp wiki.](https://fedorahosted.org/pulp/wiki/PackagePathUpdate#Howtorunmigration)

**The migration script must be run before attempting to run a sync with the new release to avoid duplicating content.**

## Version 1.1 In Development

Bug/RFE triage and planning for our 1.1 release has completed and work will begin this sprint towards the included fixes. Aligned bugs can be found [using this bugzilla query](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&#038;bug_status=NEW&#038;bug_status=ASSIGNED&#038;bug_status=MODIFIED&#038;bug_status=ON_DEV&#038;bug_status=ON_QA&#038;version=1.1.0&#038;product=Pulp&#038;classification=Community) and while there are no known changes to be made to that list, it is, as always, subject to change. Current plans are to target a June 1 release date. More information will be available on this blog as it becomes available.
