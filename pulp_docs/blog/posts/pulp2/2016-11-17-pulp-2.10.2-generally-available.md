Pulp 2.10.2 is now Generally Available in the stable repositories:

* [pulp-2-stable](https://repos.fedorapeople.org/pulp/pulp/stable/2/)
* [pulp-stable](https://repos.fedorapeople.org/pulp/pulp/stable/latest/)

This is a critical hotfix addressing a issues that resulted in 2.10.1 being
rolled back. This release also includes all of the bug fixes to Pulp Platform,
the RPM Plugin, and the OSTree plugin originally released with 2.10.1.

All hotfix issues (listed below) are tested and verified as fixed.


## Upgrading

The Pulp stable repositories are included in the pulp repo files:

* <https://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/pulp/pulp/fedora-pulp.repo> for fedora 23 & 24
* <https://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/pulp/pulp/rhel-pulp.repo> for RHEL 6 & 7

After enabling the `pulp-2-stable` repository, you'll want to follow the standard
upgrade path with migrations:

```sh
$ sudo systemctl stop httpd pulp_workers pulp_resource_manager pulp_celerybeat
$ sudo yum upgrade
$ sudo -u apache pulp-manage-db
$ sudo systemctl start httpd pulp_workers pulp_resource_manager pulp_celerybeat
```

## Hotfix Issues

This hotfix release addresses errors caused by a merge issue introduced prior to
the release of 2.10.1, tracked [in Redmine](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/2378).

While that fix was being verified, it was discovered that publishing fails on el6,
tracked [in Redmine](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/2387).

## Known Issues

- Upgrading on EL 7.3 can take longer than on other platforms. pulp-selinux package unnecessarily
  runs restorecon on /var/lib/pulp. The duration of upgrade depends on the amount of content in
  that directory.
- As part of fixing the above issue, it was also discovered that upgrading from 2.10.0 can take
  longer than from 2.9.1 and earlier versions. The fix for this issue will be released with 2.10.3.

### OSTree Support
