<!-- more -->
As we finalize the [3.0 blockers list](https://pulp.plan.io/issues?query_id=77) we want to adjust
our release plan by ~ 1 week. Here's the new schedule:

* Dec 3rd -- Release pulpcore rc9
* Dec 12th -- Final GA push to PyPI

This schedule extension will allow for a few final things to be resolved:

* A final documentation push
* Announcement details to be organized
* Release machinery and automation improvements to handle branching/cherry-picking
