The Pulp source has been migrated to a github repository. The project can be found at:

<a href="https://github.com/pulp/pulp" target="new">https://github.com/pulp/pulp</a>

The wiki will continue to be hosted at its current location for now (<a href="https://fedorahosted.org/pulp/" target="new">https://fedorahosted.org/pulp/</a>).

I&#8217;m very excited about the possibilities. In particular, github&#8217;s pull request support should provide a much friendlier interface for the community to contribute to the codebase.
