The first Pulp Community Meetup is going to take place on Tuesday, October 23, 2018 at [Raleigh
Brewing Company](https://www.raleighbrewing.com/) in Raleigh, NC. The plan is to get together from
18:00 to 20:00 EDT in the Tavern Room. We don't have a specific agenda. We want to use this as an
opportunity for Pulp users and developers to get together and discuss Pulp and it's ecosystem.
