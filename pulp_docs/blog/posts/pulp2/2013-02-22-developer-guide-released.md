Today we are happy to present the official and mostly-new Pulp Developer Guide, available from our [documentation page](/docs/). The most notable addition is a detailed guide on how to add support for new content types, including examples. The Developer Guide also includes sections on Pulp&#8217;s architecture, how to integrate with Pulp, as well as the policies and conventions used by the Pulp Team.

This release is a continuation of the Pulp Team&#8217;s commitment to providing documentation that is comprehensive, accurate, and above-all: useful. Please have a look, and as always, your feedback is valued and appreciated.
