Pulp 2.9.3 is now Generally Available in the stable repositories:

<https://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/pulp/pulp/stable/2.9/>

This release includes bug fixes to Pulp Platform, the RPM Plugin,
and the Docker plugin.

No changes have taken place between 2.9.3 Beta 2 and this release.


## Upgrading

The 2.9 stable repositories are not included in the pulp repo files, and must be
installed manually with the following repository baseurls.

Fedora 23: `https://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/pulp/pulp/stable/2.9/fedora-$releasever/$basearch/`
RHEL/Centos 6 & 7: `https://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/pulp/pulp/stable/2.9/$releasever/$basearch/`

After enabling the pulp 2.9 repository for your distribution, you'll want to
follow the standard upgrade path with migrations:

```sh
$ sudo systemctl stop httpd pulp_workers pulp_resource_manager pulp_celerybeat
$ sudo yum upgrade
$ sudo -u apache pulp-manage-db
$ sudo systemctl start httpd pulp_workers pulp_resource_manager pulp_celerybeat
```
