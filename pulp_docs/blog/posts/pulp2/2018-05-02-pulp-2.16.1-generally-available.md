<!-- more -->
Pulp 2.16.1 is now available in the stable repositories:

* [pulp-2-stable](https://repos.fedorapeople.org/pulp/pulp/stable/2/)
* [pulp-stable](https://repos.fedorapeople.org/pulp/pulp/stable/latest/)

This release includes bugfixes for Docker Support, and RPM Support.

## Upgrading

The Pulp 2 stable repositories are included in the pulp repo files:

- [Fedora](https://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/pulp/pulp/fedora-pulp.repo)
- [RHEL 7](https://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/pulp/pulp/rhel-pulp.repo)

After enabling the pulp-stable or pulp-2-stable repository, you'll want to
follow the standard upgrade path with migrations:

```sh
$ sudo systemctl stop httpd pulp_workers pulp_resource_manager pulp_celerybeat pulp_streamer goferd
$ sudo yum upgrade
$ sudo -u apache pulp-manage-db
$ sudo systemctl start httpd pulp_workers pulp_resource_manager pulp_celerybeat pulp_streamer goferd
```

The `pulp_streamer` and `goferd` services should be omitted if those services are not installed.
