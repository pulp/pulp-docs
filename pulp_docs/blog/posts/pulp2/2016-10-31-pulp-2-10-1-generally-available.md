Pulp 2.10.1 (<span style="color: darkorange" title="Happy Halloween!">Spooky Edition</span>)
is now Generally Available in the stable repositories:

* [pulp-2-stable](https://repos.fedorapeople.org/pulp/pulp/stable/2/)
* [pulp-stable](https://repos.fedorapeople.org/pulp/pulp/stable/latest/)

This release includes bug fixes to Pulp Platform, the RPM Plugin,
and the OSTree plugin.

Pulp 2.10.1 includes a variety of bug fixes to the Pulp Platform, as well
as the OSTree and RPM plugins, outlined below.


## Upgrading

The Pulp stable repositories are included in the pulp repo files:

* <https://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/pulp/pulp/fedora-pulp.repo> for fedora 23 & 24
* <https://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/pulp/pulp/rhel-pulp.repo> for RHEL 6 & 7
