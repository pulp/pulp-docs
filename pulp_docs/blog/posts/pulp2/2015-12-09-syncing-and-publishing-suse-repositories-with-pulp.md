I was recently [looking](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/927) [into](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/928) Pulp&#8217;s ability to sync and publish SUSE repositories, including those from openSUSE, SLES 11, and (after a little bit of [work](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/1358)) SLES 12.

If you&#8217;re interested, I put together a quick demo of the features and their usage with Pulp. Enjoy!



[PULP & SUSE Repositories: Syncing and Publishing](https://vimeo.com/151559399) from [Sean Myers](https://vimeo.com/rhatsmyers) on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com).

With the exception of SLES 12 support, these features are available in pulp now. SLES 12 support is Coming Soonâ„¢ in the next non-hotfix release of pulp 2.7.

If the video above fails to load, it is also available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yzvv1OpEb5I" target="_blank">on youtube</a>.
