Pulp community,

Today marks a new day in the 26-year history of Red Hat. [IBM has finalized its acquisition of Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/ibm-closes-landmark-acquisition-red-hat-34-billion-defines-open-hybrid-cloud-future), 
which will operate as a distinct unit within IBM moving forward.

 
## What does this mean for Red Hat’s contributions to the Pulp project?

In short, nothing.

Red Hat always has and will continue to be a champion for open source and projects like Pulp.
IBM is committed to Red Hat’s independence and role in open source software communities so that we
can continue this work without interruption or changes.

Our mission, governance, and objectives remain the same. We will continue to execute the existing
project roadmap. Red Hat associates will continue to contribute to the upstream in the same ways
they have been. And, as always, we will continue to help upstream projects be successful and
contribute to welcoming new members and maintaining the project.

We will do this together, with the community, as we always have.

 
If you have questions or would like to learn more about today’s news, we encourage you to review
the list of materials below. Red Hat CTO Chris Wright will host an online Q&A session in the coming
days where you can ask questions you may have about what the acquisition means for Red Hat and our
involvement in open source communities. Details will be announced on the
[Red Hat blog](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog).
