Pulp 2.11.0 is now Generally Available in the stable repositories

* [pulp-2-stable](https://repos.fedorapeople.org/pulp/pulp/stable/2/)
* [pulp-stable](https://repos.fedorapeople.org/pulp/pulp/stable/latest/)

Upgrading
=========

The Pulp stable repositories are included in the pulp repo files:
<https://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/pulp/pulp/fedora-pulp.repo> for fedora 23 & 24
<https://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/pulp/pulp/rhel-pulp.repo> for RHEL 6 & 7

After enabling the `pulp-stable` or `pulp-2-stable` repository, you'll want to follow the standard
upgrade path, with migrations:

```sh
$ sudo systemctl stop httpd pulp_workers pulp_resource_manager pulp_celerybeat pulp_streamer
$ sudo yum upgrade
$ sudo -u apache pulp-manage-db
$ sudo systemctl start httpd pulp_workers pulp_resource_manager pulp_celerybeat pulp_streamer
```

## New Features

### Docker Support
* 2114    As a user, I can perform incremental publish with Docker rsync distributor

### OSTree Support
* 2205    As a user, I want to pull older versions of trees available to atomic hosts.

### Pulp
* 1983    As a user, an importer config change or content removal will cause the next sync to be full

* 2113    As a user, I can perform an incremental publish using ISO rsync distributor
* 2132    As a consumer of Pulp content I want ISO & ISO_rsync distributor to support relative_url for consistency with yum
* 2211    As a user, I can sync a distribution unit with the existing yum_importer without requiring yum metadata
* 2212    As a user I can see in the task report of copy operation list of units which did not pass signature filter
