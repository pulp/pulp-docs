Pulp is participating in two open-source conferences coming up,
[DevConf.cz 2017](https://devconf.cz/) and [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/). These conferences are a
great place for Pulp users and developers to meet-up and get involved in the open source community.

The first is DevConf in Brno, Czech Republic on Jan 27th - Jan 29th, where Pulp will have both a
presentation and a booth. Michael Hrivnak will be giving a talk titled *Managing OSTree Repositories
with Pulp* which will show off [OSTree](https://ostree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) functionality
provided by the [OSTree Plugin](https://docs.pulpproject.org/plugins/pulp_ostree/). Pulp will share
a booth with [the Foreman project](https://www.theforeman.org/) which has a plugin named
[Katello](https://theforeman.org/plugins/katello/) that acts as a workflow and frontend tool for
Pulp and other softwares. Come by the booth to connect with developers from Pulp, Foreman, and
Katello, or contact us via IRC to meet up! 

The second is [FOSDEM '17](https://fosdem.org/2017/) in Brussels, Belgium on February 4th and 5th.
Brian Bouterse will be giving a talk titled *Debugging Hung Python Processes with GDB* which
outlines debugging techniques used while debugging Pulp. More details on the talk are
[here](https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/python_gdb/). Pulp developers will be there, so reach
out via IRC to meet up. 

If you can't make it to either of these, but are interested in joining or hosting a meetup in your
area, please let us know via IRC in #pulp on Freenode or send a note to the
[pulp-list](https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/pulp-list).
