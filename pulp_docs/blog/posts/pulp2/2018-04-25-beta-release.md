  PostgreSQL.

- The set of content in each repository is versioned.
- Promotion and rollback are fast, synchronous calls.

#### Weekly Releases to PyPI

Releases of [pulpcore](https://pypi.org/project/pulpcore/) and
[pulpcore-plugin](https://pypi.org/project/pulpcore-plugin/) will continue to be announced on the
lists.

#### Changes will be communicated

All of the Pulp 3 APIs may change during the beta process. Breaking changes will be clearly
communicated in release notes, and on mailing lists when applicable.
