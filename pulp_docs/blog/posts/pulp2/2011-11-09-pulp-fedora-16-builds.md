I forgot to mention in the last announcement that [Community Release 18](http://blog.pulpproject.org/2011/11/08/pulp-community-release-18/) will be the last build of Pulp offered on Fedora 14. Going forward support will continue on Fedora 15 and 16.

The latest testing build for Pulp is available on Fedora 16 and can be found <a href="http://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/pulp/pulp/testing/fedora-16/" target="new">in our testing repositories.</a> Instructions for using our testing repositories can be found <a href="http://pulpproject.org/ug/UGInstallation.html#latest" target="new">in the installation portion of our user guide.</a> As you can imagine by the term &#8220;testing build&#8221;, we make no guarantees as to its stability. <img src="https://www.pulpproject.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
