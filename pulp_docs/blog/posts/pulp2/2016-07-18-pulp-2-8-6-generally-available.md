<!-- more -->
Pulp 2.8.6 is now Generally Available in the stable repositories with bug fixes:

<https://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/pulp/pulp/stable/2.8/>

This release includes a small number of fixes to severe bugs in Pulp Platform,
  
the RPM plugin, and the Docker plugin.

Of particular interest to RPM users are issues #1949 and #2048, two issues
  
that were severely impacting errata-related syncing and publishing. See the
  
list of issues below for more details.

# Upgrading

The Pulp 2 and Pulp stable repositories are included in the pulp repo files:
  
<https://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/pulp/pulp/fedora-pulp.repo> for fedora 22 & 23
  
<https://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/pulp/pulp/rhel-pulp.repo> for RHEL 6 & 7

After enabling the desired repository (pulp-stable or pulp-2-stable), you&#8217;ll want
  
to follow the standard upgrade path, with migrations:

<pre>$ sudo systemctl stop httpd pulp_workers pulp_resource_manager pulp_celerybeat
 $ sudo yum upgrade
 $ sudo -u apache pulp-manage-db
 $ sudo systemctl start httpd pulp_workers pulp_resource_manager pulp_celerybeat</pre>

# Issues Addressed

  * 2056 Distribution storage path migration re-links .treeinfo files incorrectly.
  * 2012 alternate content source refresh fails with json serialization error
  * 2031 possible incorrect URL param parsing by streamer

  * 1949 re-publish takes longer than expected
