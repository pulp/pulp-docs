The Pulp v1.1 release is now available for Fedora 17. The existing repo file (<http://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/pulp/pulp/fedora-pulp.repo>) will correctly substitute in the running version of Fedora.

The only difference in this version is that the python-simplejson package must be updated for Pulp to work. The update already exists in the Fedora repositories (python-simplejson-2.5.2-1.fc17), just make sure to update it before running Pulp.
