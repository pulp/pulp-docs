Pulp 2.10.0 is now generally available, and can be downloaded from the Pulp 2.10 stable repositories:

<https://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/pulp/pulp/stable/2.10/>

New features for Pulp 2.10 include the new rsync distributor, new high-availability
features for resource managers, as well as some improvements to RPM publishing and
package validation. Several bugs were also fixed; all the details can be found later
in this announcement.

More information about these new features can be found in the release notes:

- <http://docs.pulpproject.org/en/2.10/testing/user-guide/release-notes/2.10.x.html>
- <http://docs.pulpproject.org/en/2.10/testing/plugins/pulp_rpm/user-guide/release-notes/2.10.x.html>
- <http://docs.pulpproject.org/en/2.10/testing/plugins/pulp_docker/user-guide/release-notes/2.1.x.html>

Try out the new features, and let us know how they work for you!

These two issues were listed as blockers for release candidate 1, and fixed in release
candidate 2. Upgrade testing to 2.10.0 from earlier versions of pulp is complete and has
verified that these issues do not affect 2.10.0:

- [2234](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/2234)
  Upgrading to pulp 2.9 causes sync of repos with SRPM's with a filelist field to fail.

- [2236](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/2236)
  Upgrading hto pulp 2.9 causes sync of repos with DRPM' with a "relativepath" field to fail.

No other blocking issues have been identified, which clears 2.10.0 to become generally
available a little earlier than I indicated in my previous announcement for this release.


## Upgrading

The 2.10 stable repositories are included in the pulp repo files:
https://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/pulp/pulp/fedora-pulp.repo for fedora 23 & 24
https://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/pulp/pulp/rhel-pulp.repo for RHEL 6 & 7

After enabling the pulp-stable or pulp-2-stable repository, you'll want to follow
the standard upgrade path, with migrations, to get to 2.10.0:

```sh
$ sudo systemctl stop httpd pulp_workers pulp_resource_manager pulp_celerybeat
$ sudo yum upgrade
$ sudo -u apache pulp-manage-db
$ sudo systemctl start httpd pulp_workers pulp_resource_manager pulp_celerybeat
```

## Fedora Support

Fedora 22 has reached its end-of-life. As a result Pulp 2.10 is being built for (and tested on)
Fedoras 23 and 24.
