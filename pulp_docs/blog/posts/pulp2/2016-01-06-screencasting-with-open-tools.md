I [recently posted](http://www.pulpproject.org/2015/12/09/syncing-and-publishing-suse-repositories-with-pulp/) a screencast about using Pulp to synchronize openSUSE and SLES repositories, which sparked interest in the tools I used to create the screencast. This video (the Screencast Screencastâ„¢) gives a brief rundown of those tools, with particular focus on using my current video editor of choice, OpenShot.
