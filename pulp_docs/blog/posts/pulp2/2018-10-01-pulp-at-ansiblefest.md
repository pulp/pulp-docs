<!-- more -->
Pulp will be running a booth at AnsibleFest (Oct 2-3) this year in Austin. We'll be talking about
the [pulp_ansible plugin](https://github.com/pulp/pulp_ansible) that we released earlier this year
as well as how organizations can store and manage their Ansible content on-site. As Pulp engineers,
we're big fans of Ansible and we use it to power our installer, dev environment, etc. We're hoping
to become an integral part of the Ansible community (more on this later!) so plan to see us at more
Ansible events.

To coincide with AnsibleFest, we're releasing a second RC for pulp_ansible (0.1.0rc2). We've
optimized the publishing workflow so that users no longer have to create a publisher. Instead they
can just create a publication right after syncing. For more information on this, [check out the
publishing section of the pulp_ansible
README](https://github.com/pulp/pulp_ansible#create-a-publication).

So if you're in Austin, TX for AnsibleFest, stop by our Pulp booth. We'd love to meet you and we'll
be passing out stickers and flyers.
