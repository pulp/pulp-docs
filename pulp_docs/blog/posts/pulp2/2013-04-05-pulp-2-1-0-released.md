    ## Pulp 2.1.1
    
    Work is nearing completion for our 2.1.1 release. This release is primarily to support an upcoming <a href="http://katello.org" target="new">Katello</a> release. Of particular interest will be the inclusion of another round of performance improvements when synchronizing yum repositories. Beta builds for this release are scheduled to begin next week with the release coming in early May.
