<!-- more -->
Today we are excited to announce an important milestone of the Pulp 3 project, the release of
[pulpcore 3.0.0rc1](https://pypi.org/project/pulpcore/3.0.0rc1/) and [pulpcore-plugin
0.1.0rc1](https://pypi.org/project/pulpcore-plugin/0.1.0rc1/). These packages constitute the core of
Pulp 3 and its plugin API. Both are now available on PyPI.

In the coming days, we expect plugins to announce releases that are compatible with this new RC
release of pulpcore. Please check the pulp mailing list for these releases. To plugin writers, we
suggest requiring version `~=0.1rc1` of pulpcore-plugin.

We also hope to improve documentation over the course of the RC. If you want to install Pulp 3,
check our [installation
docs](https://docs.pulpproject.org/en/3.0/nightly/installation/instructions.html).
