The Pulp community is thankful to [plan.io](https://plan.io/), who hosts the Pulp issue tracker so
well and at no cost.

#### Why is plan.io so great?

Plan.io [believes in open source](https://plan.io/redmine-and-open-source/). Their hosted platform
is built on [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org/), which is one of the largest open source, web-based
project trackers that provides issue management. They contribute downstream enhancements back to the
upstream Redmine community whenever possible, and their involvement keeps them as experts in hosting
and use of Redmine. They also have a policy to provide
[free hosting](https://plan.io/frequently-asked-questions/#item-406) for any open source project.

#### How great are they?

I help support our issue tracker, and I regularly email plan.io support. The number of emails I need
to send per issue is usually 1. It probably averages at 1.2. They resolve things very quickly
because they know Redmine so well.

In my experience, their website availability has been great. Anecdotally, I've never seen
[pulp.plan.io](https://pulp.plan.io) offline. Their certs are always working, and their servers load
fast.

#### Story time

Once they looked into a security issue I reported. Their handling of that issue was impeccable in
my opinion. They investigated, identified the source of the issue, honestly identified when the
insecure code was introduced, fixed it, and proved to me it was fixed all within 24 hours. It also
doesn't hurt that they already have a security advantage from using open source software to begin
with.

### Thanks plan.io for being awesome.
