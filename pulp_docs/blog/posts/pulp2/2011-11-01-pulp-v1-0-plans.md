<!-- more -->
Over the course of the next few sprints we&#8217;ll be gearing up for an official 1.0 release. The bulk of the desired functionality is already in place, leaving most of the remaining work to the normal release housekeeping and bug fixing tasks.

The remainder of the bugs aligned to the 1.0 release can be found <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&#038;order=Importance&#038;bug_status=NEW&#038;bug_status=ASSIGNED&#038;version=1.0&#038;classification=Community&#038;product=Pulp" target="new">using this Bugzilla query.</a> That&#8217;s not set in stone; bugs may still be added to the list either by request or depending on how the QE process goes.

The goal is to have a 1.0 release by mid-January (by FUDCon 2012 would be ideal), so now is the time to request any nagging issues be addressed. Feel free to let us know what you&#8217;d like to see included in 1.0 through any of the normal channels (chat room, mailing list, etc).
