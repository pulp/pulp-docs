Pulp is participating in the Southern CAlifornia Linux Expo
([SCALE](http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/15x)) on March 2-5, 2017 in Pasadena, California.
Michael Hrivnak will be giving a talk titled *[Deploying a Multi-Service App in Kubernetes](
http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/15x/presentations/deploying-multi-service-app-kubernetes)* which
deploys Pulp itself using containers and Kubernetes. I will be giving a talk titled *[Debugging
Hung Python Processes with GDB](http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/15x/presentations/debugging-hung-python-processes-gdb)*,
which was well received at FOSDEM.

These conferences are a great place for Pulp users and developers to meet-up. We will be posting to
[@pulpproj](https://twitter.com/pulpproj) on Twitter during the conference.
