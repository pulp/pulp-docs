## Installation &#038; Upgrade

Installation instructions can be found in the [Pulp User Guide](http://pulpproject.org/ug/UGInstallation.html#installation) at the [Pulp project web site.](http://www.pulpproject.org)

As usual, upgraded environments must run `pulp-migrate` to upgrade to the latest database changes.

### M2Crypto

Pulp now provides a patched version of m2crypto (`m2crypto-0.21.1.pulp-3.*.rpm`). The changes within are required for the newly added certificate revocation list support. The RPM can be found in the Pulp repositories along side the rest of the Pulp RPMs.

## Enhancements

  * Certificate revocation lists (CRLs) are now available for protected repositories. CRLs can be installed on a per-CA basis as necessary given the authenticated repository setup. Instructions for configuring a Pulp server to use a CRL can be found in the [Repository Authentication](http://pulpproject.org/ug/UGRepoAuth.html) section of the user guide.
  * Support has been added for installing a package group to a consumer group.
  * Custom metadata types can now be removed from existing repository metadata (only in Fedora 14 and 15; RHEL support requires a change to createrepo that is in progress).

## Build Versions

  * Pulp: 0.230-3
  * Grinder: 0.112
  * Gofer: 0.47
