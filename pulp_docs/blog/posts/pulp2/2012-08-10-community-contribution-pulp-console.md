A member of the community (stpierre in #pulp) has written an interactive shell on top of the v1 client-side APIs. The script initializes a connection to the Pulp server and makes accessible our client-side stub objects for running commands on the server. The source and README can be found on his github project:

Warm fuzzy feelings to stpierre for writing this. Unless, of course, it breaks your Pulp server, in which case: &#8220;Bad stpierre&#8221;.
