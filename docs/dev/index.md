# Overview

Pulp-Docs is a tool for serving and building the Pulp Project documentation
(see [The new Pulp "Unified Docs"](https://hackmd.io/eE3kG8qhT9eohRYbtooNww?view)).

The idea is that after installing `pulp-docs`, you'll imediatelly be able run the unified website and preview local changes as they will appear in this site.
Also, this is used for the production build.

To start using it, see the [Getting Started](site:pulp-docs/docs/dev/tutorials/getting-started/) section.
Before contributing, we recommend reading about the [Architecture](site:pulp-docs/docs/dev/reference/architecture/).
