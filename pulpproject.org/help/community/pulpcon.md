# PulpCon

## Introduction

PulpCon is the Pulp Project's online conference where the community can share, discuss and learn about what's going on in our ecosystem.
It exists [at least since 2016] (that's the oldest record we've found) and it usually happens annually around the fourth quarter of the year.

This event is organized to serve our community, so the participation of users and contributors is essential!

Stay tuned for our next editions in our [discourse] and [matrix] channels!
