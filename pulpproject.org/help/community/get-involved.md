## Reporting

- For reporting a **bug** or requesting a **feature**:
    1. First try to search if some similar issue was not already reported.
    2. If not, submit an issue to the appropriate repository (pulpcore, pulp\_rpm, pulp-oci-images, etc)
- For **security issue**, send an email to [pulp-security@redhat.com](mailto:pulp-security@redhat.com) with:
    - Pulp version
    - Vulnerability description
    - Reproduction steps.

## Issue Triage

- This meeting on Matrix has the following format:
  1. The meeting starts when at least 3 people are present.
  2. The Triage lead posts a link to the list of issues with a `Triage-Needed` label on GitHub.
  3. A link to the oldest issue in the list is shared in the chat.
  4. Participants decide whether the issue should be accepted, closed, or skipped.
     - If accepted, the Triage lead removes the `Triage-Needed` flag from the issue.
     - If closed, the Triage lead or another person closes the issue and leaves a comment with an explanation.
     - If skipped, the Triage lead or another person leaves a comment for the reporter of the issue.
  5. The process goes back to step 3 until there are no more issues left with `Triage-Needed` label.
