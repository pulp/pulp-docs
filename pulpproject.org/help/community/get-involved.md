## Open Floor / Issue Triage

This meeting happens [on pulp-meeting Matrix] every Tuesday at 10:30 ET.
It requires at least 3 maintainers to be present.

First it's **Open Floor**.
This is a time for developer discussion, feedback, and decisions on code/issues/PRs/process relating to pulpcore or plugins.
To participate, put a topic on [Open Floor Agenda] and we'll discuss it in the meeting.

Then if we have time we'll go to **Issue Triage**, which has the following format:

1. The Triage lead posts a link to the list of issues with a `Triage-Needed` label on GitHub.
2. A link to the oldest issue in the list is shared in the chat.
3. Participants decide whether the issue should be accepted, closed, or skipped.
    - If accepted, the Triage lead removes the `Triage-Needed` flag from the issue.
    - If closed, the Triage lead or another person closes the issue and leaves a comment with an explanation.
    - If skipped, the Triage lead or another person leaves a comment for the reporter of the issue.
4. The process goes back to step 2 until there are no more issues left with `Triage-Needed` label.
